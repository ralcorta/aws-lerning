## My AWS learning map through my research

This repository has all the notes about my research through courses, books, blogs, posts and other sources of knowledge. I created it for myself to manage and write down the information I learned. If it's useful to you too, all of this information is free and open to people who want to learn AWS. 

If you find it useful to add more information about something or there is a typo, feel free to create a PR to add this and I will review it as soon as I can.
